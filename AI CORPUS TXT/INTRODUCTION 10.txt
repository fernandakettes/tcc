Music education in formal institutional settings has historically functioned as a mechanism for cultural transmission, yet the question of which cultures receive representation and legitimacy within these spaces remains contentious and politically charged. The dominance of Western European classical music traditions in conservatories, universities, and school music programs reflects colonial legacies and power structures that have systematically marginalized or exoticized non-Western musical practices. As educators and scholars increasingly recognize the need to dismantle these hierarchies, ethnomusicology offers both theoretical frameworks and methodological tools for reimagining music education as a site of cultural democratization and social justice. The discipline's foundational commitment to studying all musical traditions with equal scholarly rigor and its emphasis on understanding music within specific cultural contexts provide essential perspectives for educators seeking to create more inclusive and equitable learning environments. This paper explores the intersection of ethnomusicology and music education through the lens of decolonization, examining how ethnomusicological approaches can transform curricula, pedagogical methods, and institutional structures to better serve diverse student populations and honor the multiplicity of human musical expression.
The process of decolonizing music education requires critical examination of deeply entrenched assumptions about musical value, competence, and legitimacy that permeate educational institutions. Conventional music programs often privilege literacy over orality, composition over improvisation, and individual achievement over collective participation, reflecting culturally specific values that have been universalized and naturalized through centuries of institutional practice. Ethnomusicological scholarship reveals how these pedagogical priorities are not inherent to music itself but rather represent particular cultural choices that may be irrelevant or even counterproductive when teaching musical traditions rooted in different epistemologies. For instance, many Indigenous musical practices integrate song, dance, storytelling, and ceremonial context in ways that resist compartmentalization into separate academic disciplines, while numerous African and Asian musical traditions emphasize cyclical rather than linear temporal organization, challenging Western notions of musical form and development. By bringing ethnomusicological perspectives into dialogue with critical pedagogy and postcolonial theory, educators can begin to dismantle the implicit hierarchies that position certain musical practices as sophisticated art worthy of serious study while relegating others to the status of folk culture, world music, or entertainment. This decolonial project extends beyond simply adding diverse musical examples to existing curricula; it demands fundamental reconsideration of assessment practices, performance expectations, and the very definition of musical knowledge.
The practical implementation of decolonized, ethnomusicologically informed music education necessitates institutional change, pedagogical innovation, and sustained commitment to community engagement and cultural humility. Educators must grapple with their own positionality, recognizing how their training, cultural background, and institutional context shape their understanding and teaching of diverse musical traditions. Meaningful engagement with non-Western musical practices requires moving beyond token inclusion or superficial multiculturalism toward sustained study, collaboration with practitioners from the relevant cultural communities, and willingness to cede authority to those with lived experience and cultural knowledge. Additionally, decolonizing music education involves creating space for students to explore and celebrate their own musical heritages, particularly those students whose cultural backgrounds have been historically excluded from academic music study. This paper investigates these challenges through examination of successful models of culturally responsive music education, analysis of the barriers that impede institutional change, and consideration of how ethnomusicological research methods can inform more ethical and effective pedagogical practices. By centering questions of power, representation, and cultural sovereignty, this study contributes to ongoing efforts to transform music education from a vehicle of cultural homogenization into a space where musical diversity is not merely tolerated but actively cultivated and celebrated.
